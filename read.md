# FORKING:
	* A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
	
	* Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the upstream repository.

# FETCHING:
	* Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches.
